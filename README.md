# React Developer Portfolio

## Description

This is a single-page React portfolio application designed to showcase my skills and work as a web developer. The portfolio includes various sections that allow potential employers to learn more about my experience, view my projects, contact me, and download my resume. The application is built using modern web development practices, including React, CSS, and dynamic routing.

## User Story

- **As an** employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications  
- **I want** to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
- **So that** I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and accessible on all devices.
- **Sections:** Includes sections like "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume", which are easily navigated through the header.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Clicking on a navigation title will display the corresponding section without reloading the page. The title of the active section is highlighted.
- **Portfolio Showcase:** The portfolio section displays six of my web applications with links to both the deployed applications and their respective GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form:** The contact section allows users to reach out by filling in a form. Fields include name, email, and message. Email validation is included to ensure valid email addresses.
- **Resume Download:** The resume section provides a downloadable PDF of my most recent resume.
- **Social Media Links:** Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and another social platform (e.g., Stack Overflow or Twitter) are available in the footer.

- **React** for building the user interface.
